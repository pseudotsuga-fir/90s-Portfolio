<h1>90's Theme Portfolio</h1>
<p>This repo contains the 90's theme for my actual portfolio, hosted at <a href="https://pseudotsuga-fir.github.io">pseudotsuga-fir.github.io</a></p>
<p>This page is themed after (or rather, mimics) windows 95, running netscape with my portfolio open and done in the style of a late 90's geocities page.</p>
